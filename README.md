# scRNAseq analysis of CAS cohort samples

Analysis from the following paper
Read JF, Serralha M, Armitage JD, Iqbal MM, Cruickshank MN, Saxena A, Strickland DH, Waithman J, Holt PG, Bosco A. Single cell transcriptomics reveals cell type specific features of developmentally regulated responses to lipopolysaccharide between birth and 5 years. Front Immunol. 2023 Oct 17;14:1275937. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2023.1275937.

Data generated from 10x scRNAseq of matched Cord blood mononuclears cells (CBMC) and 5 year peripheral blood (PBMC) that recieved in vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Poly(I:C), or left unstimulated.

This repository includes the raw counts data (post cellranger) which are also available from the Gene Expression omnibus (GSE232186), available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE232186
